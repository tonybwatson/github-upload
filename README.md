Spell Book
=================

This project will implement an api to pull information when a user searches for spells for the tabletop game, Dungeons & Dragons.
I may (eventually) implement multiple search bars/pages for different search types: magic, items, etc.

I'll also implement a dice rolling mechanic to aid in actually playing games - eventually.
